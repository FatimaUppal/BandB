Are you tired of the hassle and stress that comes with planning Pakistani events? Look no further than our new event planning app designed specifically for the Pakistani market!
Our app is the ultimate tool for anyone looking to plan and coordinate events in the USA. With its user-friendly interface, you can easily plan everything from weddings, Aqiqahs, Eids and other traditional events. Here are just a few of the app's many features:

- **Vendor directory**: Our app includes a comprehensive directory of vendors throughout the U.S., making it easy for you to find the perfect caterer, photographer, and more
- **Venue directory**: We know how difficult it is to find venues that have a large capacity limit and allow outside catering so we’ve narrowed down all the options for you based on your location
- **Outfits**: Sometimes it's hard to plan outfits for so many events so this app offers plenty of options for any occasion
- **Inspiration board**: Need some inspiration for your event? Our app includes an inspiration board where you can save ideas and images for easy reference.

Whether you're a professional event planner or just planning a small gathering for family and friends, our app has everything you need to make your event a success. Download it today and start planning your perfect Pakistani event!

My MVP will allow a user to log-in, choose the event and start adding vendors, venues, outfits to favorites.

I’ll do it using Spring, Java, SQL DB, Heroku and (some cloud platform).
